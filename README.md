**A rigorous, 120-day curriculum designed to build a deep foundation in Mathematics and Computer Science.** 

This open-source curriculum bridges the gap between high school algebra and advanced topics like Functional Analysis, Topology, and Theoretical Computer Science. It is designed for self-learners who want to build "operating system" level knowledge—the non-negotiable skills for deep technical work.

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Zero Friction:** Runs entirely in the browser. No servers, no logins, no databases.
- **🧠 First-Principles:** Focuses on proving *why* things work, not just *how* to use them.
- **🐍 Python Integration:** Mathematical concepts are paired with Python code blocks (Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib) to build intuition through computation.
- **📊 Interactive Tracking:** Check off lessons as you go. View your consistency streaks and completion percentages.
- **📱 Responsive:** valid HTML5/CSS3. Looks great on mobile and desktop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Philosophy

This project believes in the power of **Simple Systems**.
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**: ensuring long-term durability and zero build-step requirements for learners.
- **MathJax/KaTeX**: Beautiful properties typesetting for rigorous math.
- **Local First**: Data lives in `localStorage`. You own your progress.

## 💻 Local Development
